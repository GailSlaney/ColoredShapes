# ColoredShapes
- This is a simple project to get my feet wet as I return to the coding world after several years of being focused elsewhere. It is my very first project during my waitlist period with GetCoding.

## How to Play the Game
- Using a random number generator, a colored shape displays on the screen. 
-   The player (likely a young child) can then name the color and shape. 
-   When the player clicks the image, words display beneath, stating the color and shape. 
-   This will also teach the child how to spell colors and shapes.
- Clicking "Play Again" button generates a new shape and color.

## Potential Future Updates
- Another level can display the words using capital vs lower case letters.
- I also considered changing the font color of the color-word to match the word.(ie. when clicking on the image of a green triangle, the word Green would display in green font; the word triangle would display in black).
- I was thinking of making a higher level that displays the words first. The player can read the words and click the word to display the shape, and discover if they read the words correctly.
